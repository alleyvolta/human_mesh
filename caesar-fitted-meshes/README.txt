This fitted meshes were used to learn the human shape spaces, as described in the
paper:

Leonid Pishchulin, Stefanie Wuhrer, Thomas Helten, Christian Theobalt and Bernt Schiele.
Building Statistical Shape Spaces for 3D Human Modeling. 
ArXiv, March 2015

Please cite the paper if you are using these shape spaces in your
work.

The fitted meshes may be used free of charge for non-commercial and
educational purposes. For any other purpose you must contact the
authors for permission. These shape spaces may not be redistributed
without permission from the authors.

Each fitted mesh is stored as N x 3 matlab matrix of 3D coordinates
of N vertices.
